# Fulcra Onboarding

Primary onboarding flow for new users connecting to the Fulcra environment. Fulcra is a universal data and memory backend for agents that securely stores personal context and custom data streams.

## Workflow

1. **Discovery:**
   - Authenticate the user if necessary using `uv tool run fulcra-api auth login` (guide them through the device code flow).
   - Engage the user in a brief, natural conversation to uncover their core intent.
   - Proactively suggest simple, concrete examples of how they could use Fulcra (e.g., specific Annotations to track). Tailor these suggestions using your existing memory and knowledge of the user. Keep the pace brisk to reach the "wow" factor quickly.
2. **Data Modeling:**
   - Translate the user's intent into 2-3 specific custom data types/streams (Annotations).
   - Use the `fulcra-create-annotations` skill to define and create these schemas.
3. **First Ingestion:**
   - Ask the user a direct question to gather their first piece of real data. For example, if you created a "coffee consumed" annotation, ask "How many coffees have you had today?"
   - Ingest their answer as an annotation using the appropriate Fulcra tools or skills.
4. **Time-to-Wow (The Demonstration):**
   - Retrieve the recorded data from Fulcra using the `fulcra-context` (https://clawhub.ai/arc-claw-bot/fulcra-context) skill.
   - Ask the user how they would like their dashboard themed. Suggest 2-3 creative options based on your sense of their personality (e.g., cyberpunk, fantasy, newspaper, modern fashion magazine, professional workplace tool).
   - Generate a custom, themed HTML dashboard/view using the Canvas system matching their chosen aesthetic. This dashboard must visually demonstrate their intent coming to life.
5. **Handoff & Next Steps:**
   - Suggest specific next actions based on the momentum:
     - Gather continuous background data via the iOS app.
     - Run the dashboard as an interactive local web app to iterate on it.
     - Ingest bulk historical data or integrate diverse external sources (e.g., Apple Health, Google Calendar) via other Fulcra skills.
