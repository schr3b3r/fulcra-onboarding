# Fulcra Onboarding

Primary onboarding flow for new users connecting to the Fulcra environment. Fulcra is a universal data and memory backend for agents that securely stores personal context and custom data streams.

## Workflow

1. **Discovery:**
   - Authenticate the user if necessary using `uv tool run fulcra-api auth login` (guide them through the device code flow).
   - Have a brief, natural conversation to capture the user's core intent. Ask questions dynamically based on their responses. Keep it moving—the goal is to get to the "wow" factor quickly.
2. **Data Modeling:**
   - Translate their intent into 2-3 specific custom data types/streams (Annotations).
   - Use the `fulcra-create-annotations` skill to define and create these schemas.
3. **First Ingestion:**
   - Prompt the user for an initial piece of data or use context naturally derived from the conversation.
   - Record this data using the appropriate Fulcra tools or skills.
4. **Time-to-Wow (The Demonstration):**
   - Retrieve the recorded data from Fulcra using the `fulcra-context` (https://clawhub.ai/arc-claw-bot/fulcra-context) skill.
   - Ask the user how they would like their dashboard themed. Suggest 2-3 creative options based on your sense of their personality (e.g., cyberpunk, fantasy, newspaper, modern fashion magazine, professional workplace tool).
   - Generate a custom, themed HTML dashboard/view using the Canvas system matching their chosen aesthetic. This dashboard must visually demonstrate their intent coming to life.
5. **Handoff & Next Steps:**
   - Suggest specific next actions based on the momentum:
     - Gather continuous background data via the iOS app.
     - Run the dashboard as an interactive local web app to iterate on it.
     - Ingest bulk historical data or integrate diverse external sources (e.g., Apple Health, Google Calendar) via other Fulcra skills.
