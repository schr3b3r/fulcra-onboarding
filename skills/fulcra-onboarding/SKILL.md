# Fulcra Onboarding

Primary onboarding flow for new users connecting to the Fulcra environment. Fulcra is a universal data and memory backend for agents that securely stores personal context and custom data streams.

## Workflow

1. **Pre-flight Check:**
   - Read and execute the instructions in `skills/fulcra-prerequisites/SKILL.md` to silently verify and install `uv` if necessary. This must pass before proceeding.

2. **Discovery:**
   - Read and execute the instructions in `skills/fulcra-onboarding-discovery/SKILL.md` to handle user authentication, uncover their core intent, and suggest concrete use cases. Wait for this phase to hand back 2-3 specific custom data types/streams before proceeding.

3. **Data Modeling:**
   - Translate the user's intent into 2-3 specific custom data types/streams (Annotations).
   - Read and follow the instructions in `skills/fulcra-create-annotations/SKILL.md` to define and create these schemas.
   - **Crucial Memory Step:** When you create these annotations, explicitly remember the returned `ANNOTATION_ID` and the exact `data_type` for each one. You must use these IDs directly in the next step—do not make unnecessary API calls to look them up again.

4. **Record First Data:**
   - Pick one of the newly created annotations and ask the user a direct question to get their first piece of data (e.g., if you created a "coffee consumed" annotation, ask "How many coffees have you had today?").
   - Once they answer, record their response into Fulcra by reading and following the instructions in `skills/fulcra-record-annotations/SKILL.md`.

5. **Time-to-Wow (The Demonstration):**
   - Read and execute the instructions in `skills/fulcra-onboarding-demonstration/SKILL.md` to retrieve the recorded data, ask the user for a preferred aesthetic, and generate a custom themed HTML dashboard to display directly in the chat.

6. **Handoff & Next Steps:**
   - **App Download (Required):** Always conclude by directing the user to the [Fulcra Context iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1633037434).
   - **Value Proposition:** Briefly explain that the app unlocks automatic background sync (Apple Health, location, calendar) and gives them a quick, native interface to log the custom Annotations they just created.
   - **Optional Momentum:** If the user is highly engaged, suggest running their new dashboard locally or exploring further bulk data integrations.
