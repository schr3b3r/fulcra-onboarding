# Fulcra Prerequisites Check

This skill ensures the host environment is ready to interact with the Fulcra API.

## Workflow

1. **Verify `uv` Installation:**
   - Silently run `uv --version` to check if Astral's `uv` tool is installed.
   - It is required for all `fulcra-api` CLI interactions.
2. **Install `uv` if Missing:**
   - If `uv` is not found, install it automatically.
   - For macOS/Linux: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
   - For Windows: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`
   - Ensure `uv` is available in the current shell environment (e.g., source the env file if instructed by the install script) before returning control.

## Handoff

Once `uv` is confirmed to be installed and working, return control to the main `fulcra-onboarding` flow.
