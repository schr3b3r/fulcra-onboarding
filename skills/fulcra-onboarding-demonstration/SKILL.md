# Fulcra Onboarding: Demonstration (Time-to-Wow)

This skill handles Step 5 of the onboarding process. The goal is to immediately show the user the value of the data they just modeled and recorded by presenting it in a highly personalized, visual way using an inline HTML dashboard.

## Workflow

1. **Retrieve Data:**
   - Retrieve the user's recently recorded data from Fulcra. 
   - **How to retrieve:** 
     - First, silently run `uv tool run fulcra-api catalog` to list available data types. Find the exact identifier (name or ID) for the annotation the user just created.
     - Then, use that identifier as the `DATA_TYPE` argument in the `uv tool run fulcra-api get-records <DATA_TYPE> <TIME_RANGE>` CLI command (e.g., `uv tool run fulcra-api get-records "MyCustomAnnotation" "1 day"`). 
     - This is the most reliable method for accessing raw recorded data. Do *not* use external skills for this step.

2. **Theme Selection:**
   - Ask the user how they would like their dashboard themed.
   - Suggest 2-3 creative, distinct options based on your sense of their personality and the data they are tracking (e.g., cyberpunk, fantasy, newspaper, modern fashion magazine, professional workplace tool, retro 8-bit).
   - Keep this interaction brief and engaging.

3. **Generate HTML Dashboard:**
   - Once a theme is chosen, generate a custom HTML file visualizing the data.
   - **Crucial: The "Wow" Factor:** Because the user has likely only recorded a single piece of data, the design must carry the experience. Do not generate a boring standard chart. 
   - **Design Directives:**
     - **Metaphorical UI:** Design a UI that fits the data type and theme (e.g., a retro receipt for coffee, a glowing HUD for fitness, a vintage polaroid for a mood check-in).
     - **Rich Styling:** Use embedded CSS to create a highly polished look. Leverage Google Fonts, CSS gradients, complex box-shadows, and layout techniques (Flexbox/Grid).
     - **CSS Animations:** Include simple CSS animations (e.g., pulsing glows, slide-ins, typing effects) to make the dashboard feel alive.
     - **Intent-Driven Copy:** Include clever, personalized micro-copy in the dashboard that nods to the user's broader intent and the specific theme.
     - **Visual Extensibility:** Design the layout to explicitly convey that this is a living, expandable surface. Include UI hints like "Empty Slots," grayed-out "Coming Soon" sections, or placeholder modules for other related data types they might want to track in Fulcra next.
   - Ensure the dashboard visually incorporates the actual data retrieved in Step 1.
   - **Bulletproof Presentation:** To avoid permission or rendering errors, present the HTML to the user using this resilient approach:
     1. **Primary Display (Optional):** If you are confident you can display the dashboard in a richer way (e.g., using a native Canvas integration or Control UI embed), you may attempt it. However, do not attempt to reconfigure the agent's settings to achieve this.
     2. **File Fallback (Required):** Always save the generated HTML to a file in the workspace (e.g., `fulcra-dashboard.html`), output the absolute path, and tell the user they can open it directly in their web browser.
     3. **Source Fallback (Required):** Always provide the full HTML source code in a markdown ` ```html ` block within your response as an ultimate fallback.

## Handoff

When presenting the HTML dashboard, explicitly emphasize that this is a living, iterative document. Tell the user they can ask you to tweak the design, add new metrics, or define entirely new data types to record in Fulcra right now.

Once the dashboard has been successfully generated and presented, wait for the user's reaction. After acknowledging their response, return control to the main `fulcra-onboarding` flow to handle the final App Download handoff.
